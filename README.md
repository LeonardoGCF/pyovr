# pyovr
Python bindings for Oculus Rift SDK

Runs on Windows only at the moment, but so does OVR SDK 0.7

Uses installed 32-bit OVR dll on Windows, so you must have the Oculus 0.7 Runtime installed to use this module. Get the Oculus Runtime at https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/pc/0.7.0.0-beta/Oculus_Runtime_for_Windows/

This module also assumes you are running a 32-bit version of python. In particular, it was developed and tested with Python version 2.7 installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/
